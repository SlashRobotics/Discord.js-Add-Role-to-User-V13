The code in index.js is the code needed to create a Discord bot that responds to commands and handles roles in both DM and guild channels on the latest version of
Discord as of 1/29/2022. You are welcome to use the code for whatever you need. Please do not sell the code or use the code to create bots that you will sell.
This release is for non-profit projects only. If you wish to use this code in any other fashion, please contact me on Discord @Slash#1995 ID:(852806935782883339).

HOW TO GET THE BOT ONLINE
1. Find a hosting service for your bot, I reccomend replit.com. Create a new project and select node.js. 

2. Go to packages, then install the following;
   discord.js; node; express; mongoose

3. Create or copy the index.js file and place the code inside.
4. Go to secrets (Environment variables), set the key as 'token' without the quotation marks and the value as your Discord bot's token from the discord developer portal
5. Click add new secret
6. Add a new file named ".replit" without the quotation marks, inside put the following: run = "npm start"
7. Edit the index.js file to fit what your bot will do, learn how to use it and make your own bot out of it.
8. Press run.
9. Create a free account at https://uptimerobot.com/ and add your bot's replit link to as a monitor set to check every 25 minutes.
your bots replit link will look something like: https://projectname.accountusername.repl.co/. You can find this above the console window in replit after running the
project successfully.
